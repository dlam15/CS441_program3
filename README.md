## CS441 Custom Drawing

For this assignment I created an app that draws a picture of a flower.
On the first screen the user can choose which color they want the
flower to be and then on the next screen the user can draw it. The
amount the flower is drawn is based on the progress of the seek bar. By
slowly moving the seek bar to the right, the flower will look like it
is being drawn while moving it in the opposite direction would make the
flower would start to disappear.
